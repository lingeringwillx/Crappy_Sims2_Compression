Old branch with more benchmarking and debugging code.

#### Sims 2 Compression Experiments

<img src="https://github.com/lingeringwillx/CrappySims2Compression/assets/111698406/5e1e045d-ab02-48c0-9a69-f8fb5ab57cbc" width="400">

<br/>Current build can be compiled with Visual C++ Build Tools. Run `compile.bat` to compile.

Usage: `dbpf-recompress -args package_file_or_folder`

Benchmark: `python benchmark.py package_file`

There is now an experimental release that could be used as a drop-in replacement for The Compressorizer's original executable. It achieves faster compression in the following ways:

1- By utilizing all of the cores of the CPU for compression.

2- By using level 5 compression parameters instead of level 9.

To use it, just download the .exe file and put it in the same directory as The Compressorizer, overwriting the old file.

Alternatively, you can just drag and drop your file or folder to the executable and it will be compressed.

#### Parameters

| Flag | Name | Description
| - | - | - |
| `-l` | Compression Level | Can be `-l1`, `-l3`, `-l5`, `-l7`, or `-l9`. Higher values mean stronger but slower compression |
| `-r` | Recompress | Decompress the file then compress it again, can provide a bigger compression if the older compression is weak, but will slow down the compression (Note: This is always enabled in the gui version) |
| `-p` | Parallel | Use all cores for compresson, will speed up the compression but will use 100% of CPU during compression (Note: This is always enabled in the gui version) |
| `-d` | Decompress | Decompress without compression |
| `-q` | Quiet | Don't output anything to the console except for errors |

[Explanation of The LZ77/LZSS Compression](https://go-compression.github.io/algorithms/lzss/): QFS/Refpack is based on this compression.

[DBPF Package Information](https://modthesims.info/wiki.php?title=DBPF): Contains information on the game's .package format.

[ModTheSims](https://modthesims.info/wiki.php?title=DBPF/Compression): Information about the compression used by the game, likely has some subtle mistakes here and there but still a good resource.

[Explanation of zlib](https://www.euccas.me/zlib/): The Compressorizer's code is heavily based on this library.

#### Implementations

[Old Mystical C Implementation by benrg](http://www.moreawesomethanyou.com/smf/index.php/topic,8279.0.html): Old hard to read implementation based on zlib code. This is the strongest version of the compression out there and it's the same one used by The Compressorizer.
